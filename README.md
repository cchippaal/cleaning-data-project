=====================

Peer Assessment Project for Getting and Cleaning Data


This project includes a script called `run_analysis.R` which can be ran against the dataset that is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

Download and extract the archive to a folder named `data`. You can then execute the `run_analysis.R` on that dataset.
